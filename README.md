# Kondoot ICE

ICE is the new Interaction and Chat Environment that has been implemented as part of the new Kondoot site.  ICE is driven using [Server-Sent Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) and a simple RESTful API for pushing interactions back through the system.

While we primarily use [restify](https://github.com/mcavage/node-restify) for other node endpoints in the Kondoot stack, ICE has been built using [tako](https://github.com/mikeal/tako) due to it's excellent support for streaming interfaces.
